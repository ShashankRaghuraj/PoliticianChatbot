# PoliticianChatbot

Alex Jones is an infamous political talk show host, whose ideologies have been known to exert a detrimental influence on a significant global audience through the dissemination of misinformation. In response to these concerns, I took proactive action by developing a sophisticated chatbot utilizing GPT-3 and OpenAI technologies.

The primary objective of this endeavor was to investigate whether the chatbot's generated responses bore a resemblance to the content typically propagated by the said talk show host during his broadcasts. By subjecting the chatbot to various prompts and analyzing its outputs, I sought to gain valuable insights into the patterns of misinformation dissemination.

Moreover, this project served as my initial stride toward a larger mission of combatting misinformation on the internet. My determination to create a safer online environment motivated me to actively contribute to limiting the proliferation of harmful information.

Through this innovative application of AI, I demonstrated my technical prowess and commitment to utilizing technology for the betterment of society. By proactively addressing issues of misinformation, I am eager to contribute further toward creating a more informed and responsible digital landscape.
